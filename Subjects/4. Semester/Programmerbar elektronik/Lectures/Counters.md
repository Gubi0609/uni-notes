A register that goes through a predetermined sequence of binary values (states), upon the application of input pulses on one or more inputs, is called a counter. Counters count the number of occurrences of an event, that is, input pulses that occur either randomly or at uniform intervals of time. Counters are used extensively in digital design for all kinds of applications. Apart from general purpose counting, counters can be used as clock dividers and for generating timing control signals.
