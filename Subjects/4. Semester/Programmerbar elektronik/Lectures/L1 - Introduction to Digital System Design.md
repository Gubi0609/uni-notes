# Notes
An FPGA operates using _Logic Gates_.
- Compared to CPU and GPU:
	- CPU does everything _sequential_ and different cores handle different tasks
	- GPU does everything _parallel_ and handle everything together
		- High power consumption
	- FPGA are coded to perform specific tasks.

While a CPU and GPU might run while no tasks are available (idle) and consume power, an FPGA will just wait.

- CPU → Fast
- GPU → Larger tasks
- FPGA → Precise and fast
