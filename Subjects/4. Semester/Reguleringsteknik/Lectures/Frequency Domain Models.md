We work with a transfer function
## $$G(s)=\frac {Q(s)}{P(s)}$$
Where $Q$ and $P$ are polynomials in the variable $s$.
- The roots of $Q(s)$ are called the _zeros_
- The roots of $P(s)$ are called _poles_

We assume that the degree of $P(s)$ is higher than that of $Q(s)$.

To convert from [[Time Domain Models]] we _Laplace transform_ our function.

When we rearrange, we want to _collect all_ $x(s)$ on one side.
