For a system as the above, we input $y_{ref}$ and our output $y$ into the control system $K(s)$. This effectively means, that we input the _error_ $e=y_{ref}-y$. This is passed forward to the _System_ $G(s)$. Our output will then be
## $$y(s)=G(s)\cdot K(s)\cdot e(s)$$ $$e(s)=r(s)-y(s)$$ $$y(s)=G(s)\cdot K(s) \cdot (r(s)-y(s)$$ $$(1+G(s)\cdot K(s))\cdot y(s) = G(s)\cdot K(s)\cdot r(s)$$ $$\frac {y(s)}{r(s)}=\frac {G(s)\cdot K(s)}{1+G(s)\cdot K(s)}$$
