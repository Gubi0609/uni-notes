A first order system has _one pole_ and is described by
## $$H(s)=\frac k {\tau s+1}$$ $$\dot x=-\frac 1 \tau x+\frac k \tau u$$$$y=x$$

Where $k$ is the _DC-gain_ and $\tau$ is the _time-constant_.

The system has a pole in $s=-\frac 1 \tau$. This means that the smaller time-constant, the faster system response.

# Impulse response
The impulse response of a first order system is 
## $$y(t)=ke^{-\frac 1 \tau t}$$

## Step response
The step response of a first-order system is
## $$y(t)=k\left(1-e^{-\frac 1 \tau t}\right)$$
