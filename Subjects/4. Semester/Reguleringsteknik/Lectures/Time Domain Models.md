There are two types of linear time-domain models

# Continuous time state space
This is based on _differential equations_

Is a system of first order differential equations and an output equation.

# Transformation to State Space Form
When we have an $n^{th}$ order differential equation, we will need to reformulate it to a system of first order differential equations [[Time Domain Models#Continuous time state space|Continuous time state]].
