A linear discrete-time system
## $$x_{k+1}=\Phi x_k$$
where $x_k\in\R$ and $\Phi\in\R^{n\times n}$ is _asymptotically stable_ if

The system is asymptotically stable if and only if all eigenvalues have magnitude smaller than one (they are within the unit circle (think back to [[Subjects/3. Semester/Signalbehandling/Signalbehandling|Signalbehandling]])).
