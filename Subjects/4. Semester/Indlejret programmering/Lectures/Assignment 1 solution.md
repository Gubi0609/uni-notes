The assignment has the following requirements

- The program must implement a 0-7 counter
- The current count must be represented by a color on the on-board RGB LED
    - 0: Off
    - 1: Green
    - 2: Blue
    - 3: Cyan
    - 4: Red
    - 5: Yellow
    - 6: Magenta
    - 7: White
- The counter must be able to count up and down
- The counter should proceed on step with a button push
- The direction of the counter must change with a double button push
- The counter must enter AUTO mode when the button is held for 2 seconds or more
    - When in AUTO mode the counter must proceed one step every 200 ms
- A button push while in AUTO mode should return the counter to manual mode

I'll start with the basics by implementing basic logic to change through the colors and enabling the pins correctly.

The RBG LED which will be used for this can be found on port F of the GPIO. The LED pins are as follows
- Red: PF1
- Blue: PF2
- Green: PF3

We can use this to cycle through the colors by enabling the RBG pins, which will combine to the colors.
The colors, the corresponding count, and their corresponding HIGH/LOW pins can be seen
