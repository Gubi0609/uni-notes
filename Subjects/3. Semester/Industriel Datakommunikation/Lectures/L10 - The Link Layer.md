# Notes

## Capturing and analyzing Ethernet frames
1. What is the 48-bit Ethernet address of your computer?
	1. c0:
2. What is the 48-bit destination address in the Ethernet frame? Is this the Ethernet address of gaia.cs.umass.edu? (Hint: the answer is no). What device has this as its Ethernet address? (Note: this is an important question, and one that students sometimes get wrong. Re-read pages 468-469 in the text and make sure you understand the answer here.)
3. Give the hexadecimal value for the two-byte Frame type field. What upper layer protocol does this correspond to?
4. How many bytes from the very start of the Ethernet frame does the ASCII “G” in “GET” appear in the Ethernet frame?
