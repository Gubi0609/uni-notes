# Relevant Themes
- OSI model [[L1 - Introduction]]
- Application: Supporting network applications [[TheApplicationLayer_I.pdf]]
- Protocols
	- Examples for different applications [[TheApplicationLayer_I.pdf#page=11]]
- Surrounding layers and API
	- None above
	- Transport below (according to IP stack) [[TheApplicationLayer_I.pdf#page=4|TheApplicationLayer_I page 4]]
		- Sockets [[TheApplicationLayer_I.pdf#page=7]]
	- Presentation below (according to OSI)) [[Intro.pdf#page=33|Intro page 33]]
- Hosts the application (Webpage, Program, E-mail. P2P file, VoIP etc.)
- Architectures [[TheApplicationLayer_I.pdf#page=13]]
	- Client-Server
		- Server: Always on host, permanent IP dresss, Data centers for scaling [[TheApplicationLayer_I.pdf#page=14|L3 page 14]]
		- Client: Communicate with server, maybe intermittently connected, dynamic IP, not direct P2P communication (always Client-Server-Client)
	- P2P
		- _Not_ always on server, different end systems communicate directly, Peers request from other peers (provides service to other peers in return) **Self scalability**, dynamic IP adresses and intermittently connected peers. [[TheApplicationLayer_I.pdf#page=15|L3 page 15]]
	- Publisher-Subscriber (IoT)
		- Register _Topic_ at _Message Broker_. Example MQTT (used by ROS i think)
			- Lightweight and efficient
			- Scalable
			- Bi-directional Communication
		- [[TheApplicationLayer_I.pdf#page=17|L3 page 17]]
	- Cloud
		- Decentralized "virtual" srver, dynamic resource management, scalable, complex [[TheApplicationLayer_I.pdf#page=16|L3 page 16]]
- Processes [[TheApplicationLayer_I.pdf#page=19|L3 page 19]]
	- _Client_ process: Process that initiates communicaiton
	- _Server_ process: Process that waits to be contacted
- Sockets: [[TheApplicationLayer_I.pdf#page=20|L3 page 20]] to [[TheApplicationLayer_I.pdf#page=21|page 21]]
	- Like a door. Is a gateway to other layer (transport layer)
	- Process sends/receives messages to/from its socket
	- Processes rely on transport infrastructure on other side of socket to actually deliver/receive anything.
	- Sending process basically shoves message out of the door
	- Receiving process gets message from the door
- Identifier [[TheApplicationLayer_I.pdf#page=22|L3 page 22]]
	- IP address is only enough to identify device. To identify process on device _port number_ is used.
	- Example port numbers: HTTP server **80**, mail server **25**.
	- Need both IP and port number to communicate with process. This is called an _identifier_
- Application layer Protocol defines ([[TheApplicationLayer_I.pdf#page=23|L3 page 23]])
	- Type of message exchanged (eg. request, response etc.)
	- Message syntax (What fields are relevant in message and how are fields defined)
	- Message semantics (meaning of information in fields)
	- Rules for when and how processes send/respond to messages
	- (Open protocols defined in RFCs and allows for interoperability) Don't think this is necessary tho.
- HTTP (**H**yper**T**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol) [[TheApplicationLayer_I.pdf#page=31|L3 page 31]]
	- Text with hyperlinks
	- Web's application layer protocol
	- Also HTTPS where **S** stands for _Secure_ (This is more relevant for the [[Subjects/3. Semester/Industriel Datakommunikation/Exam/Transport Layer|Transport Layer]])
	- Client-Server:
		- Client is a browser that _requests_ and _displays_ Web objects
		- Server _sends_ objects in _response_ to requests
		- Both use HTTP

==MAYBE MORE RELEVANT FOR [[Subjects/3. Semester/Industriel Datakommunikation/Exam/Transport Layer|Transport Layer]]==
- Non-Persistent HTTP versus Persistent HTTP [[TheApplicationLayer_I.pdf#page=33|L3 page 33]]
	- Non-Persistent
		- Open and Closes TCP connection for _each_ object sent.
		- More overhead in opening and closing for each object.
		- Response time for _one_ object: 2 RTT + file transmission time [[TheApplicationLayer_I.pdf#page=36|L3 page 36]]
		- Browsers often open _parallel_ TCP connections to fetch referenced objects
	- Persistent HTTP
		- Multiple objects can be sent over a single TCP connection between client and server
		- Just on RTT for all the referenced objects


- DNS: domain name → IP [[Lecture 4 - DNS.pdf]]
	- Like Name → Address [[Lecture 4 - DNS.pdf#page=3|L4 page 3]]
	- Multiple Domain Names can be on same IP (server centers) *Host aliasing* [[Lecture 4 - DNS.pdf#page=7|L4 page 7]]
	- One Domain Name can have multiple IP (like google, that have servers around the world)
		- *Load distribution* [[Lecture 4 - DNS.pdf#page=7|L4 page 7]]
	- **Implemented as application-layer protocol**
- DNS is a distributed, hierarchical database [[Lecture 4 - DNS.pdf#page=10|L4 page 10]]
	- Root DNS
	- .com DNS, .org DNS, .edu DNS
	- facebook.com DNS, amazon.com DNS, pbs.org DNS, nye.edu DNS, umass.edu DNS
	- Client queries root → root queries .com → .com queries amazon.com → return IP to client
- Local DNS name server [[Lecture 4 - DNS.pdf#page=13|L4 page 13]]
	- Does _not_ strictly belong to hierachy
	- Each ISP (Internet Service Provider) has one (residential ISP, company, university)
		- Also called _default name server_'
	- Acts as proxy, forwards query into hierarchy
- DNS caching [[Lecture 4 - DNS.pdf#page=17|L4 page 17]]
	- Once any server learns a mapping (eg. amazon.com → IP) it _caches_ that mapping
		- An entry is associated with a TTL (Time To Live) and is deleted after said time
	- TLD (Top Level Domain (.com, .edu, .org ...)) are usually cached in local DNS server
		- Root name servers not often visited because of this
	- **Caching used for speed**
	- Cached entry also has _type_ which is used to determine the type of application. Fx:
		- type=a
			- name is hostname
			- value is IP address
		- type=cname 
			- name is alias name 
			- value is canonical name
			- (eg www.ibm.com is really servereast.backup2.ibm.com)
		- type=mx is a mailserver
			- **value** is name of mailserver associated with **name**
			- Mailserver can have same as a webserver
		- type=ns 
			- **name** is domain (eg. foo.com)
			- **value** is hostname of autoritative name server for this domain
				- eg. punktum.dk hosts .dk domains
- DNS uses UDP 
- Decentralized netværk er oftest bedre end centralized, da du så har flere servere spredt over hele verdenen. På den måde skal folk fra USA ikke kommunikere med en DNS server i europa for at få IP adressen for en hjemmeside i USA. Og hvis én server går ned, er der stadig flere serverer der er oppe.
