A process is NOT a program located on the hard disk. Only when it is brought into memory is it a process

## Process States
![[Pasted image 20251107091243.png]]

Each circle is a _state_ and each arrow is an _action_ that takes the process between states.

We use this to store the process' state, because it can be paused/suspended while running.
To save these states, we use [[Process Control Block]].
