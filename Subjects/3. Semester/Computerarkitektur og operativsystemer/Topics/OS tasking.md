We have either **Signle-tasking OS** or **Multi-tasking OS**

## Single tasking OS
![[Pasted image 20251107083725.png]]

We run only _one_ process at a time. Preferable for slower/smaller/more limited computers/chips.

In this example, we show MS-DOS

## Multi tasking OS
![[Pasted image 20251107083815.png]]

Here we have *multiple* processes running at the same time.

In this example we show FreeBSD (a variant of Unix)
