# Topics
## Process synchronization
Processes can execute concurrently or in parallel [[COS - lecture 9 - Itslearning.pdf#page=3|L9 page 3]]
**Concurrent**
- CPU scheduler switches rapidly between processes to provide concurrent execution.
- Processes may only _partially_ complete before being stopped in favor of another process.

**Parallel**
- Multiple instruction streams (different processes) execute _simultaneously_ on separate processing cores.

Can both cause issues regarding the integrity of data shared by several processes.

### Bounded buffer [[COS - lecture 9 - Itslearning.pdf#page=4|L9 page 4 - 8]]
A shared _bounded_ buffer is implemented as a **circular** array with two logical pointers.

Write pointer points to the next _free_ position in the buffer
Read pointer points to the next _full_ position in the buffer

Buffer is empty, when in == out
Buffer is full, when (in+1) == out

_Race condition_ can occur here
